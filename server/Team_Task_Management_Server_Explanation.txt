Team Task Management Server Explanation

1. Server Structure:

The server is built using Node.js with Express.js framework and MongoDB as the database. The main components are:

- server.js: The entry point of the application
- routes/: Contains route definitions
- controllers/: Handles the business logic
- models/: Defines database schemas
- middleware/: Custom middleware functions

2. Main Components:

a) server.js:
   - Initializes Express app
   - Sets up middleware (cors, json parsing, request logging)
   - Connects to MongoDB
   - Defines main routes
   - Sets up error handling
   - Starts the server

b) Routes:
   - auth.js: Handles user authentication (login/register)
   - teams.js: Manages team-related operations
   - tasks.js: Handles task-related operations

c) Controllers:
   - teamController.js: Manages team creation, retrieval, and member addition
   - taskController.js: Handles task creation, retrieval, and team-specific tasks

d) Models:
   - User.js: Represents user information and team associations
   - Team.js: Defines team structure with owner and members
   - Task.js: Represents task details, including team and user associations

e) Middleware:
   - auth.js: Verifies JWT tokens for protected routes
   - requestLogger.js: Logs incoming requests
   - errorHandler.js: Handles errors during request processing

3. Functionality Flow:

a) User Authentication:
   - Users can register and login through /api/auth routes
   - Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is issued
   - The token is used to access protected routes

b) Team Management:
   - Authenticated users can create teams (POST /api/teams)
   - Users can view their teams (GET /api/teams)
   - Team owners can add members to their teams (POST /api/teams/:teamId/members)

c) Task Management:
   - Users can create tasks (POST /api/tasks)
   - Users can view all their tasks (GET /api/tasks)
   - Users can view tasks for a specific team (GET /api/tasks/team/:teamId)

4. Data Models:

a) User:
   - name: String (required)
   - email: String (required, unique)
   - password: String (required)
   - role: String (enum: ['user', 'admin'], default: 'user')
   - createdAt: Date
   - teams: Array of Team ObjectIds

b) Team:
   - name: String (required)
   - owner: User ObjectId (required)
   - members: Array of User ObjectIds
   - createdAt: Date

c) Task:
   - user: User ObjectId (required)
   - title: String (required)
   - description: String (required)
   - status: String (enum: ['todo', 'in progress', 'done'], required)
   - dueDate: Date (required)
   - team: Team ObjectId
   - assignedTo: User ObjectId

5. Security Measures:

- JWT authentication for protected routes
- Password hashing (assumed to be implemented in auth routes)
- Role-based access control (admin vs user roles)

6. Scalability and Maintainability:

- Separation of concerns (routes, controllers, models)
- Use of middleware for common functionalities
- Error handling middleware for consistent error responses
- MongoDB for flexible data storage and retrieval

7. Flow Chart:

The following flow chart represents the basic flow of a request through the server:

[Client Request]
       |
       v
[server.js (Express App)]
       |
       v
[requestLogger Middleware]
       |
       v
[Route Handling]
       |
   ____|____
   |       |
   v       v
[Auth]   [Protected Routes]
   |       |
   |       v
   |    [auth Middleware]
   |       |
   v       v
[Controller Functions]
       |
       v
[Database Operations]
       |
       v
[Response to Client]
       |
       v
[errorHandler Middleware (if needed)]

8. Detailed Request Flow:

1. Client sends a request to the server.
2. The request is received by the Express app in server.js.
3. requestLogger middleware logs the incoming request.
4. The request is routed to the appropriate handler based on the URL.
5. For protected routes, the auth middleware verifies the JWT token.
6. The corresponding controller function is called to handle the request.
7. The controller interacts with the database using Mongoose models.
8. The response is sent back to the client.
9. If any errors occur during this process, they're caught by the errorHandler middleware.

This server structure provides a solid foundation for a Team Task Management system, allowing for user authentication, team creation and management, and task assignment and tracking within teams. The modular design ensures scalability and ease of maintenance as the project grows.
